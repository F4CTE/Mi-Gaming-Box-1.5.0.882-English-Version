# Mi-Gaming-Box-1.5.0.882-English-Version

## Works perfectly with 1.5.0.882 !
for older versions please refer to this repo Devoskar/Mi-Gaming-Box-1.3.0.822-English-Version

1) Close Mi Gaming Box (if you have not already done so)
2) Move the files index.html and main.js along the path:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Timi Personal Computing\GamingBox\1.5.0.882\dist\`

or to a different path if the program was installed in a different directory (if there is no folder in the path, please make sure Mi Gaming Box version 1.3.0.822 is installed)

3) Launch Mi Gaming Box
4) Share your experiences on https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/
5) Profit! :+1:

P.S.
If you own (just like me :wink:) Xiaomi's Mi Gaming Laptop (2nd edition) here you can find the latest system drivers, this page also always has the latest version of the Mi Gaming Box app :point_down: https://www.mi.com/service/bijiben/drivers/15-game-8
